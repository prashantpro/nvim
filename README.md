# Neovim config (Text Editor to Power Editor to IDE level)

After referring to multiple docs, articles, example configs, and videos, I have finally settled on a Neovim configuration that is perfect—for my needs.
This repo serves as a reference of how one could configure and setup Neovim, for that **lightweight yet productive IDE** most of us keep searching for.

VIM way is not for everyone, but it should certainly be given a shot. If you get good at it, it's hard to go back to anything else.
But it's fairly easy to quit `:q!`—if you didn't get the joke, this one's gonna need some work.

This repo contains branches that serve as a reference to help transition our neovim experience to the next level.
